Adventures in systems archaeology

Synopsis:
ps aux:

redis-server conf/redis.conf

Where is this running from? It's a relative dir, so only god knows.

*enter linux*

cd /proc/pidofproc
cat environ
there it is, PWD=/home/mrdude/oldgitrepo
sure enough, /home/mrdude/oldgitrepo/conf/redis.conf exists.
now hopefully mrdude hasn't edited the conf file since launching redis 2 years ago....
