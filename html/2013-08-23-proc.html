        <p>Synopsis:</p>
System $x was running low on disk space. I do what I normally do, ssh in, check disk space, and check what's running.;
<pre>
$ df -h 
$ ps auxf
</pre>
First question, what's running?
<pre>
redis-server conf/redis.conf
</pre>
Sure enough, the low disk space is from redis's over chatty log. I can wipe the log, edit the config
to raise the log level minimum to "warning," and restart redis, if I was confident I could restart redis.

unfortunately, redis was launched with a relative path to the config, so I have no idea where the config lives.

<div class="sidenote">
    When launching daemons, *always* use the full path to file arguments.
    It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting">self documenting.</a>
    So you're lazy, and don't want to type the full path? Me too!
    <pre>
    $ redis-server $PWD/conf/redis.conf
    $ ps auxf
    </pre>
    The shell will expand $PWD before it hits the operating system, leaving a nice easy to read line in the process tree.
</div>

        <p>Where is this running from? It's a relative dir, so only god knows.</p>

        <h4>*enter linux*</h4>
<pre>
$ cd /proc/pidofproc
$ cat environ
</pre>
        <p>
            there it is, PWD=/home/mrdude/oldgitrepo
            sure enough, /home/mrdude/oldgitrepo/conf/redis.conf exists.
        </p>
        <p>Now hopefully mrdude hasn't edited the conf file since launching redis 2 years ago....<p>
